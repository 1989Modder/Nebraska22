This year, the gubernatorial race has devolved into a free-for-all as Governor Pete Ricketts' hand-picked successor, Jim Pillen, squares off against Charles Herbster, a far-right Trump associate involved in the planning of Trump's rally leading up to the January 6 attack, Brett Lindstrom, a moderate financial advisor from Omaha, and Theresa Thibodeau, a former Ricketts acolyte going on a renegade effort of her own.\n<p> Will Nebraska favor Pillen to carry on Ricketts' legacy, Herbster to solidify Trump's reign over the red states, Lindstrom to revive bipartisanship, or Thibodeau to focus on local issues? Only time, effort and backroom dealings will tell!\n<p></p>",
